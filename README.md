example and explanation of the array.ForEach.

for the .ForEach method - essentially runs the parameters within the brackets for each element within the array.
in this example below -

it is saying "for array1, element0 = console.log(element0), element1 = console.log(element1), element2 = console.log(element2), and that would complete the block of code.

const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));

// expected output: "a"
// expected output: "b"
// expected output: "c"

For loop syntax come in three syntactic flavours:

    1. for (initialize; condition; increment);
    2. for (initialize; condition; increment) single statement;
    3. for (initialize; condition; increment) {multiple statements;}
